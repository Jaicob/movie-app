# Project 1 - Movie App

**Movie App** shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: ** 5 ** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **scroll through current movies** from the Movie Database API
* [x] Layout is optimized with the [ViewHolder](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView#improving-performance-with-the-viewholder-pattern) pattern.
* [x] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  * [x] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
  * [x] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] User can **pull-to-refresh** popular stream to get the latest movies.
* [ ] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Picasso-Library#configuring-picasso) for each image during loading.
* [x] Improved the user interface through styling and coloring.

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [ ] Allow user to view details of the movie including ratings and popularity within a separate activity or dialog fragment.
* [ ] When viewing a popular movie (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars) the video should show the full backdrop image as the layout.  Uses [Heterogenous ListViews](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Implementing-a-Heterogenous-ListView) or [Heterogenous RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Heterogenous-Layouts-inside-RecyclerView) to show different layouts.
* [ ] Allow video trailers to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView.
    * [ ] Overlay a play icon for videos that can be played.
    * [ ] More popular movies should start a separate activity that plays the video immediately.
    * [ ] Less popular videos rely on the detail page should show ratings and a YouTube preview.
* [ ] Leverages the [data binding support module](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Applying-Data-Binding-for-Views) to bind data into layout templates.
* [ ] Apply the popular [Butterknife annotation library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-Butterknife) to reduce boilerplate code.
* [x] Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using [Picasso transformations](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Picasso-Library#other-transformations)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

- Unfortunately I wasn't able to explore the optionals much this project (This is the only week where that will be the case though, and I intend to revisit this project) so things went pretty smoothly. The only hiccup I had was making sure the images were sizing correctly, I can imagine as you try to do more complext tasks with images things can get pretty tricky. Also, this isn't strictly an android problem, but my mobile layout and color scheme design abilities are something I really want to work on. I often find myself spending too much time fiddling around with colors, text sizes, etc.
